Ark Bot
This discord bot checks for the newest patch notes for the xbox version of Ark

Get Started:

1. To get started, sign up for a discord bot and note your bot's token that is generated.
   https://discord.com/developers/applications/

2. In the root folder of this project (in the same place as config.json) create a file called auth.json

3. Save the contents of auth.json as the following, replacing xxx with the token from step 1.
   {
   "token":"xxx"
   }

4. run `npm install`

5. run `npm run build` (this will compile the typescript to javascript)

6. run `npm start` to start running your discord bot!
